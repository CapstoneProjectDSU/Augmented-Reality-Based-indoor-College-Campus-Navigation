# Augmented Reality Based College Campus Indoor Navigation

While GPS is widely used for outdoor navigation, it falls short indoors. While some maps are available on campus, users do not receive continuous assistance to reach their destinations. They may attempt to plan their routes using these static maps, but once they begin walking in their intended direction, they lack ongoing guidance. Indoor navigation often requires expensive additional hardware. This project explores techniques for indoor campus
positioning, pathfinding, and route guidance. Our project's goal is to introduce a cost-effective indoor campus navigation system. Our solution utilizes the built-in sensors in mobile devices to pinpoint user location and combines them with AR technology to provide an immersive navigation experience.




## Problem Statement

● Navigating inside campus, particularly for
newcomers, is challenging due to limited guidance
and the absence of effective navigation systems.

● Need for a AR based navigation experience for
better visualization and understanding of the route
compared to 2D Maps or boards.

## What our Project does ?

● Our project aims to create an affordable and
user-friendly indoor Campus navigation system by
utilizing the sensors in mobile devices.

● We will develop a mobile apk that integrates with
AR Foundation for precise indoor positioning and
ARCore for real-time AR guidance.

● Users will have the option to choose their desired destination within the campus, and they will receive AR-based navigation to enhance their visual user experience.
